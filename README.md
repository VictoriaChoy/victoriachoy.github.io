# About me 
I’m passionate about innovative teaching methodology with a student-centered approach. I have over 10 years of experience strategizing effective learning experiences for students from preschoolers to adults in the transdisciplinary approach. I grew up in a coastal city in southeast China, and am an avid STEAM project developer, and fan of choreography and music. I’m excited to work with you!

# Teaching Philosophy
## - The Period of Self-awareness 
After working in foreign trade of OEM products such as sensors for ABB autorobots for six years, I started my teaching career in quest of my own potential, freedom, and identity. I chose not to work in a public school after I acquired an English teaching certificate for high school because of insufficient networking and possible restrictions on teaching at a public school. Thus I chose to work in the private sector which served middle-class families in particular. Beginning from IELTS and TOEFL examination technique preparation, I tried to look for a job that was irreplaceable, unlike the previous ones I got as a deputy general manager or a foreign trade manager. Then I began to realize that something was wrong, after witnessing students’ struggle against exam-oriented education and resentment of English learning. It has prompted me with a long journey to inquire about students’ early-year experiences for their typical problems in their later life, and the most important of all, the effective methods to cultivate students’ interest for English learning.

## - The Period of Practice & Collaboration
The journey began when I got an offer as an ESL teacher from _English First_, a world-renowned education group based in Sweden, a country famous for its student-centered K-12 education system. After struggling for about two months observing teachers down-the-hall, attending routine workshops, and learning by doing such as managing classes of early learners, preparing related lessons, assisting co-teachers, I started to take initiative in incorporating my interest with students’ into lesson planning, and adapting or creating new activities depending on the context. I think my practice have shown consistent evidence for the IB pedagogy on the transdisciplinary nature in language teaching, especially project-based learning with differentiated rewards designed on topics in the curriculum, both for positive reinforcement and more opportunities for the drill of expressive skills. The hands-on approach has been well developed since then.

Apart from my major responsibility to deliver innovative classes to early learners, I shared my ideas of teaching with colleagues and was a problem solver, for example, covering sick colleagues' classes on short notice with equal quality and impression on students whom I met for the first time (because the students recognized me on the street), and setting up a home router for a new comer. 

As an empathetic teacher, I extended concerns for low-achievers and trouble makers by listening carefully to them, responding actively, and helping individual students with their social and emotional well-being. This, I suppose, is the epitome of inclusion education. 

Teacher Collaboration Projects 

I made prototypes for teachers to decorate their classrooms, sampled photoframes for students' headshots, gave teaching ideas for their projects based on picture books and topics in the curriculum, and organized events such as marketing and parental meetings.
