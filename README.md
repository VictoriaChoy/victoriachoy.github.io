  # About me 

> I’m passionate about innovative teaching methodology with a student-centered approach. I have about 10 years of experience strategizing effective learning experiences for students from preschoolers to adults in the transdisciplinary approach. I grew up in a coastal city in southeast China, and am an avid STEAM course developer, and a fan of music, jazz and hip pop choreography, and traditional Chinese martial arts.

## Teaching Philosophy

#### - The Period of Self-awareness (2013-2014)
After working in foreign trade of OEM products such as sensors and cables for ABB industrial robot arms for six years, I started my teaching career in quest of my own potential, freedom, , identity, and a meaningful life. I chose not to work in a public school after I acquired an English teaching certificate for high school because of insufficient networking and possible restrictions on teaching at a public school. Thus I chose to work in the private sector which served middle-class families in particular. Beginning from IELTS and TOEFL examination technique preparation, I tried to look for a job that was irreplaceable, unlike the previous ones I got as a deputy general manager or a foreign trade manager. Then I began to realize that something was wrong, after witnessing students’ struggle against exam-oriented education and resentment of English learning. It has prompted me with a long journey to inquire about students’ early-year experiences for their typical problems in their later life, and the most important of all, the effective methods to cultivate students’ interest for English learning.

_How English testing is failing Chinese students by driving numbers, not proficiency_

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109213222/179449911-7e20fb5c-334d-44c7-adb4-f29d5e99d588.png)

https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/united-states/article/2177403/how-english-testing-failing-chinese-students

#### - The Period of Practice & Collaboration (2015-2017)

The journey began when I got an offer as an ESL teacher from _English First_, a world-renowned education group based in Sweden, a country famous for its student-centered K-12 education system. After struggling for about two months observing teachers down-the-hall, attending routine workshops, and learning by doing such as managing classes of early learners, preparing related lessons, assisting co-teachers, I started to take initiative in incorporating my interest with students’ into lesson planning, and adapting or creating new activities depending on the context. I think my practice have shown consistent evidence for the IB pedagogy on the transdisciplinary nature in language teaching, especially project-based learning with differentiated rewards designed for topics in the curriculum, serving multiple purposes such as provocations, project models, positive reinforcement, and more opportunities for the drill of productive skills. The hands-on approach has been well developed since then.

Movable Origami Monkey for Grammar Drill (6-7 years old)

2D Shapes Developed into 3D Projects (3-5 years old): This project was for an unit of 2D shapes from _Journeys_ , a famous reading program for grades K-6 published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. In order for preschoolers to inquire about the shapes and their attributes with a hands-on approach, I developed the projects as a models for students to talk about what they could build with the shapes, connecting with their prior knowledge of flowers, arts, handicraft (wind chime), and robot toys. 

![3d shapes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109213222/179360363-0ab0b4bf-2188-42a3-82ce-cb016e50fda6.JPG)

Apart from my major responsibility to deliver innovative classes to early learners, I shared my ideas of teaching with colleagues through small talk, workshops and teaching materials archived in our class portfolio. I was also a problem solver, for example, covering sick colleagues' classes on short notice with equal quality and impression on students whom I met for the first time (because the students recognized me on the street). I think it took courage, flexibility, charm, and improvisatory quality to tackle emergency like this. Being sort of a tech geek, I also helped setting up a home router for a new comer from the USA. 

As an empathetic teacher, I extended concerns for low-achievers and trouble makers by listening carefully to them, responding actively, and helping individual students with their social and emotional well-being. This, I suppose, is the epitome of inclusion education. 

## - Teacher Collaboration & Leadership (2017- now)

I made prototypes for teachers to decorate their classrooms, sampled photoframes for students' headshots, gave teaching ideas for their projects based on picture books and topics in the curriculum, and organized events such as life club, puppetry theater for marketing and parental meetings.

Picture Book Project: the book is about a birthday party from _Oxford Reading Tree_ with an ort program to operate on the computer. Apart from using the interactive white board with the program, we used the project-based approach to engage early learners based on different teacher strengths. The idea of mango slices arranged in the shape of a birthday cake with letter-shaped biscuits was co-deveoped by the team. The white board decorated with balloons and laminated letter cards served as a setting for early learners to put on a puppet show in the same theme.

Puppetry Show for Marketing: this show was organized for the marketing department targeting the age group from toddlers to lower-primary students. Teachers were paired to put on one mini-show, keeping in mind effective interaction with the audience. A section was designed for children volunteers to take part in the show with English expressions learned on the spot.

Weekly Life Club: teachers take turns to host the life club in different themes at the big kitchen with a projector, a screen and a host computer, so that students could take related classes and prepare snack food.

## - The Period of Identity Establishment (2021- now)


# Teaching Documentation

In my teaching experience with students from toddlers to adults in a second-tier city and a first-tier one, I have seen anxiety and pressure overwhelming students preparing for exams, and a lot of joy and freedom enlivening children studying for interest, excitement, and sense of accomplishment.

# Evaluation of Teaching & Educational Leadership

I have been using my previous bosses as counterexamples to reflect on my own leadership style and the future leader I would like to be. The only one of them has become my partner because she has changed and accepted IB philosophy, so has me. IB education aims to foster leadership within the learning community through the realization of the key elements, such as IB mission, international-mindedness, learner profile, approaches to learning, agency and self-efficacy. We learn from each other on a worldwide scale. We take action towards common goals with critical thinking, problem-solving skills, collaboration, and shared reflection.
