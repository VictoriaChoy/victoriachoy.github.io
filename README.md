I’m passionate about innovative teaching methodology with a student-centered approach.

# - Teaching Philosophy
## The Period of Self-awareness
When I started as a teacher for IELTS and TOEFL examination technique preparation, I tried to look for a job that was irreplaceable, unlike the previous ones I got as a deputy general manager or a foreign trade manager. I began to realize that something was wrong, witnessing students’ struggle against cram exam-oriented education. It has prompted me with a long journey to inquire about effective learning. 

## The Period of Practice
The journey began when I got a teaching job from English First, a world-renowned education group based in Sweden. I enjoyed the freedom to incorporate my interest with students’ into lesson planning.
