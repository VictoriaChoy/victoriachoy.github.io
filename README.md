## Welcome to Victoria's Teaching Portfolio 

# About me 
Iâ€™m passionate about innovative teaching methodology with a student-centered approach. I have about 10 years of experience strategizing effective learning experiences for students from preschoolers to adults in the transdisciplinary approach. I grew up in a coastal city in southeast China, and am an avid STEAM project developer, and a fan of music, jazz and hip pop choreography, and traditional Chinese martial arts.
