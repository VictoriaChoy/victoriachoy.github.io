# About me 
I’m passionate about innovative teaching methodology with a student-centered approach. I have over 10 years of experience strategizing effective learning experiences for students from preschoolers to adults in the transdisciplinary approach. I grew up in a coastal city in southeast China, and am an avid STEAM project developer, and fan of choreography and music. I’m excited to work with you!

# Teaching Philosophy
## - The Period of Self-awareness 
After working in foreign trade of OEM products such as sensors for ABB autorobots for six years, I started my teaching career in quest of my own potential, freedom, and identity. I chose not to work in a public school after I acquired an English teaching certificate for high school because of insufficient networking and possible restrictions on teaching at a public school. Thus I chose to work in the private sector which served middle-class families in particular. Beginning from IELTS and TOEFL examination technique preparation, I tried to look for a job that was irreplaceable, unlike the previous ones I got as a deputy general manager or a foreign trade manager. Then I began to realize that something was wrong, after witnessing students’ struggle against exam-oriented education and resentment of English learning. It has prompted me with a long journey to inquire about students’ early-year experiences for their typical problems in their later life, and the most important of all, the effective methods to cultivate students’ interest for English learning.


## - The Period of Practice & Collaboration
The journey began when I got an offer as an ESL teacher from English First, a world-renowned education group based in Sweden, a country famous for its student-centered K-12 education system. After struggling for about two months observing teachers down-the-hall, attending routine workshops, and learning by doing such as managing classes of early learners, preparing related lessons, assisting co-teachers, I started to take initiative in incorporating my interest with students’ into lesson planning, and adapting or creating new activities depending on the context. I think my practice have shown consistent evidence for the IB pedagogy on the transdisciplinary nature in language teaching, especially differentiated rewards designed on topics in the curriculum, aiming at project-based learning, positive reinforcement, and more opportunities for the drill of expressive skills.

As an empathetic teacher, I extended concerns for low-achievers and trouble makers by listening carefully to them, responding actively, and helping individual students with their social and emotional well-being. This, I suppose, is the epitome of inclusion education. 

Apart from my major responsibility to deliver innovative classes to early learners, I was a problem solver to cover sick colleagues' classes on short notice with equal quality and impression on students whom she met for the first time.
