<img src="collaborator s.gif" align="center"/>

A **professional learning community** should share a common understanding of the purpose for learning to align with **IBâ€™s philosophy and mission**, implement programs with the guidance of **IB program standards and practices**, embrace **student-centered** educational approaches, and collaborate in **effective relationships** to foster **international-mindedness**, **approaches to learning** and **learner profile** in response to the various **local contexts** and the **changing needs of the learning community**. The dynamic learning community work together with coordinated efforts, aiming at positive impact on families, and students' and teachers' lifetime development, and the social progress under the guidance of educational principles, ie. **Social Constructivism** Vygotsky (1978), **Theory of Cognitive Development** Bruner (1990), **Multi-intelligence** Gardner (1993), **Progressivism** and **Education and Democracy** John Dewey (1916), **Social Reconstructionism** Theodore Brameld (1956), **Critical Pedagogy** Freire Paulo (1970).

## Collaborative Strategies

A collaborative learning community implements effective collaboration strategies, contributes their expertise, experiences, and perspectives to the teamwork in both formal and informal settings.

Workshops, class observations, and teaching modelling are some formal meathods for professional learning. Pre-class and after-class discussions are more informal to share perspectives on learning and teaching.

## Reflection on Educational Leadership

I have been using my previous bosses as counterexamples or role models to reflect on my own leadership style and the future leader I would like to be. The only one of them has become my partner because she has changed and accepted IB philosophy, so has me. IB education aims to foster leadership within the learning community through the realization of the key elements, such as IB mission, international-mindedness, learner profile, approaches to learning, agency and self-efficacy. We learn from each other on a worldwide scale. We take action as global citizens towards common goals with critical thinking, problem-solving skills, collaboration, and shared reflection.
