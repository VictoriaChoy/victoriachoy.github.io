# A Life-long Inquirer

<img src="inquirer s.gif" align="center"/>

Learning and teaching experiences keep shaping our identity throughout the life-time teaching career. The **identity-construction inquiry** has prompted me to critically analyze the similarities and differences between China and the west in **social, economic, political, historical, cultural and educatinonal contexts**. One of the recent findings is the possible integration of IB philosophy and methodology into teaching Chinese as a foriegn language. Through seminars held by CTCSOL and literature by IB and non-IB scholars, I have compared and contrasted the methodology of CTCSOL and IPA, from both of which I have acquired teaching certificates. Having known about the political nature of education, I have also inquired about the state capitalism in the east vs the counterpart in the west.

**Assessment Culture** has arisen as valid measures of learning against traditional tests since the 20th century. It develops within the **learning community** shared understanding and language of what, why and how to assess to inform and adjust teaching and learning. Fostering assessment culture requires development of assessment capability, integrated-assessment policy, collaboration in assessment among students and teachers,and professional development.

### Diagnostic Assessment and Formative Assessment

I find _Using Student-Involved Classroom Assessment to Close Achievement Gaps_ the most inspiring to me. The article criticizes norm-referenced tests for their insufficiency and advocates the prioritization of **student-involved classroom assessment** to reduce achievement score gaps. Three tools for student involvement are elaborated in assessment process to define and apply criteria, record keeping to monitor improvements and communication to share self-assessment with others. Four conditions to reduce achievement gaps and use assessment effectively are elicited: focus on clear purposes, accurate reflections of improvement, continuous descriptive feedback on improvement, student involvement in classroom assessment process.

#### Functions of Diagnostic and Formative Assessment (Brown and Sanford, 2011, p. 8)

- Using screening and formative assessment data to identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes

- Monitoring the effectiveness of instruction (i.e., progress monitoring)

- Implementing multi-leveled evidence-based instruction that is matched to studentsâ€™ instructional needs

- Data-based decision making for instruction, movement within the multi-level system, and disability identification (in accordance with state law)
