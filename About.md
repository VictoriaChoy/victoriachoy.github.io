Hi, I am Victoria from southeast China. My Chinese name is Xiaoyan Cai. I am passionate about innovative teaching methodology with a student-centered approach. I have about 10 years of experience strategizing effective learning experiences for students from preschoolers to adults in the **transdisciplinary approach**.

I am an avid STEAM course developer, and a fan of music, jazz and hip pop choreography, and traditional Chinese martial arts.

## A Brief Autobiography

The educational system where I was educated before high school is somewhat similar to the one I am working in, that is IB (IBO, 2018), Reggio Emilia (Lindsay, 2016) and EYFS  with their roots in John Dewey's educational principles, such as **experiential learning**. I remember the initiative I took in studying English in grade 7. Before that, I knew nothing about English. After I got a zero for the first quiz, I made up my mind to work hard on it. The method was listening to the audio while repeating the words heard and jotting them down in the notebook. Now I know the method I used intuitively is **combined learning styles** or **multimodal learning**.

I think I was lucky enough to have the freedom to explore efficient learning methods not just in literacy but also in science when I was able to try scientific principles on the plants in our house and my father's wasted Hi-Fi kits on which he did experiments I observed frequently. I once managed to turn on an old radio with a low-volt charger found in my father's toolkit with the principles of electrical circuit and metal conductors learned from the junior high school. Then I used the radio quite often to enjoy pop music. The most enjoyable experience was my little **projects** during summer and winter vacations. I used to design paper clothes for my doll with the smoke packages from my father and a compass to make cones as skirts hollowed out and fastened with paper stripes. I would say the project was inspired by both my mother who was a fashion-shop owner and my father who worked in a construction company with architectural knowledge.

Although the enjoyment in learning was replaced by pressure when I got into high school, busy preparing for the college entrance exams, I have been able to transfer **interest-oriented** learning methods to the classroom since I became a teacher of young children.

One of the most impactful learning experiences in high school would be the time when I worked out a solution to a complex mathematical question with the presence of my classmate who was seeking my help but I kept silent the next day when my maths teacher said there was no solution to the question. It is a **tradition** to respect our teachers without questioning them and I was shy as a teenager. But I believe I am different now as a professional and dedicated **IB educator**.
