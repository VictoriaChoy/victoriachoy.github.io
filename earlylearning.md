# Early Learning Systems (1.5-12 years old)

## Wonders of the Early Childhood World

These approaches share a **holistic, integrated outlook on learning** that features the children and teachers as **capable learners** with the ability to **self-regulate** and take **responsibility** for being part of a **democratic classroom**, while having the ultimate desire for a **peaceful world**. Each approach brings a passion and uniqueness to how this outcome could best be achieved.

### IB as the Beacon for International Education

![ib](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109213222/184272273-3b6730eb-e8e4-42a7-adbb-bc33d31b84c4.png) 

I believe that IB will continue to be a **beacon** for educators in international education, because of its inclusiveness and instructivity for all national curricula. The **transdisciplinary inquiry** is beyond any discipline-based curriculum, with an aim to take up the challenges of **21st century**, way beyond any individually-focused system. IB has already become a major inspiration for national curricula in both developed and developing countries, including the Next Generation Science Standards in the USA, Cambridge IQTS curriculum, the alignment research in Australian National Curriculum, Chinese science currciculum and kindergarten guidance for inquiry-based curriculum. With an increasing number of educators entering IB system from all over the world, a significant rise in innovative fruits will be gained through collaboration by teachers, students and the learning community. This will ensure IB’s leadership in international education.

### Alignment between John Dewey’s Theories and IB Principles (IB Mission and Learner Profile)

Dewey’s theory about the responsibility of the school for bringing forward positive social change is evident in IB mission statement to “develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world”. 

His notion about inquiry as the process of sensing something indeterminate or out of balance (i.e. a problem) with subsequent analysis of relevant elements resulting in adjustment to restore balance (Larry A. Hickman, 1997) is the core element of IB PYP methodology as “an authentic way” for students to make meaning with the world around them (IBO, 2018, p. 40). The attribute of IB learner profile - inquirers also involves nurturing inherent curiosity, developing skills for inquiry and sustaining love for learning (IBO, 2018) . In his notion about reflection in experience, he emphasized the importance of thought or reflection in making meaning from experience ( Dewey, 1938, p.66), which is reflected in the attribute of LP -reflective.

He believes the learning process is how students relate the new knowledge with prior experiences (Talebi, 2015, p. 5) and thus co-construct new learning through social intercourse instituted in school (Dewey, 1938, p.12). The learning in early years of PYP is also featured with play co-constructed between students and teachers (IBO, The Learner, p.11), and “students co-construct knowledge with peers and teachers in a social-constructivist environment” (IBO, The Learner, p. 29).

- IB PYP and Montessori 

As an established philosophy for preschool and primary education, **Montessori** fouses on developing students who are capable, accountable, knowledgeable people who have the **strong sense of self** they will need to thrive in the **real world**. One of its key elements is **child control**, whose echo can be found in IB’s **agency and self-efficacy**, but the difference is the **roles of teachers** in the two systems, where Montessori tends to downplay teachers’ guidance while IB emphasizes the **cooperative learning between teachers and students** with more positive outcomes since **relationship** plays a crucial part in the effectiveness of learning. 

The **five great stories** in elementary Montessori can be integrated into the IB PYP's transdisciplinary framework featured with the six transdisciplnary themes.

- IB PYP and Reggio Emilia

<https://thereggioapproach.weebly.com/reggio-philosophy-and-principles.html>

John Dewey’s approach to inquire about open-ended materials through **joint learning** in a **community of learners** can also be found in Reggio Emilia principle (Edwards, Gandini, Forman, 1998, p.185). According to Arleen (Dodd-Nufrio, 2017),  Reggio Emilia educators found inspiring many of the basic ideas that originated in the United States.  Valentine (1999) further connected **Dewey’s influence* with the classrooms and community of Reggio Emilia. 

**Problem-based learning** is also a well-known Reggio Emilia approach that is actually **Dewey-inspired**, for the approach’s definition that through the facility of “project work, peer collaboration, social intimacy, assuming responsibility, and self-documentation of their own learning process”, children “co-construct and negotiate knowledge” (Cockrell et al, 2000, pp. 347-363).

- EYFS Reforms- Creating a Balance between Montessori and Reggio Emilia

EYFS practitioners are expected to use children's interests to ignite learning so children feel valued, confident and motivated to learn.

Like Reggio and Montessori, Development Matters supports the idea that children must learn at their own pace. The document is split into age ranges that are less specific than before and practitioners are expected to support a child wherever they are in their learning rather than moving them on before they are ready.

- Cambridge Learner and Approaches to Teaching

According to my instructor of the introductory course for Cambridge Assessment International Education Primary English, UK is trying to move away from high-stake tests that have been widening the achievement gap between low-achievers and high-achievers. I believe from the course material, IB principles have been serving as an illumination for the educatinal reform in UK.
