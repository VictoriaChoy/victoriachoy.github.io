## Early Learning Systems (1.5-12 years old) - Wonders of the Early Childhood World

These approaches share a **holistic, integrated outlook on learning** that features the children and teachers as **capable learners** with the ability to **self-regulate** and take **responsibility** for being part of a **democratic classroom**, while having the ultimate desire for a **peaceful world**. Each approach brings a passion and uniqueness to how this outcome could best be achieved.

I believe that IB will continue to be a **beacon** for educators in international education, because of its inclusiveness and instructivity for all national curricula. The **transdisciplinary inquiry** is beyond any discipline-based curriculum, with an aim to take up the challenges of **21st century**, way beyond any individually-focused system. IB has already become a major inspiration for national curricula in both developed and developing countries, including the Next Generation Science Standards in the USA, Cambridge IQTS curriculum, the alignment research in Australian National Curriculum, Chinese science currciculum and kindergarten guidance for inquiry-based curriculum. With an increasing number of educators entering IB system from all over the world, a significant rise in innovative fruits will be gained through collaboration by teachers, students and the learning community. This will ensure IBâ€™s leadership in international education.

EYFS practitioners are expected to use children's interests to ignite learning so children feel valued, confident and motivated to learn.

Like Reggio and Montessori, Development Matters supports the idea that children must learn at their own pace. The document is split into age ranges that are less specific than before and practitioners are expected to support a child wherever they are in their learning rather than moving them on before they are ready.
