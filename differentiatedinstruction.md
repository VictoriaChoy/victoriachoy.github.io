# Differentiated Instruction & Visiable Thinking Routines

## Meaning of Differentiated Instruction

- Affirming that students have different learning needs, strengths, styles, interests and preferences

- Affirming the importance and value of all students’ work

- Maintaining a commitment to learning standards and goals for all students

- Increasing the variety in teaching, learning, and assessment in order to reach more students and respond to their preferences, styles, interests and strengths

- Acknowledging what students already know and can do

- Providing appropriate levels of challenge and active engagement in rigorous, relevant and significant learning

### Example of Differentiated Instruction and Assignments for a Transdisciplinary Unit (8-12 Years Old)

Students were asked to complete the worksheet according to what they liked and could do. For example, a 6th-grader boy finished more writing than a 2nd-grader did.

## Visible Thinking Routines

One inquiry-based practice I think I have been doing well is visible thinking. I have been using graphic organizers in reading for writing classes. Before that, students have already learned how to sort out information with graphic organizers in reading and thinking session, ‘compare and contrast’ in particular. After practice for a couple of times, some high performers have shown a trait of thinking routine to analyze information in different contexts by creating their own graphic organizers, while some low performers have managed to demonstrate deeper and diverse understanding of some materials after comparison and contrast. All of the students have shown a better performance in writing when they get used to such thinking routine.
