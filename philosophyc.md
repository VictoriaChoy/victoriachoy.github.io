# The Period of Collaboration and Leadership (2017-now)

<img src="leadership s.gif" align="center"/>

I have been in charge of **curriculum development** and teaching faculty since I started working in day-care centers for preschoolers and primary students. I also made prototypes for teachers to decorate their classrooms, sampled photoframes for students' headshots, gave teaching ideas for their projects based on picture books and topics in the curriculum, and organized events such as life club, STEAM club, holiday celebrations, puppetry theater for marketing, and parental meetings.

## Picture Book Projects

The book is about a birthday party from _Oxford Reading Tree_ with an ort program to operate on the computer. Apart from using the interactive white board with the program, we used the **project-based** approach to engage early learners based on teachers' different strengths. The idea of mango slices arranged in the shape of a birthday cake with letter-shaped biscuits was co-deveoped by the team. The white board decorated with balloons and laminated letter cards served as a setting for early learners to put on a puppet show in the same theme. Multiple projects were initiated by different teachers. Their ideas were also great inspirations for me. I believed the achievements by **teamwork** had a significant advantage over those by individuals.

## Puppetry Show for Marketing

This show was organized for the marketing department targeting the age group from toddlers to lower-primary students. We first created a forest setting with cardboards, drawings and glue gun. Then teachers were paired to put on one mini-show, keeping in mind effective interaction with the audience. A section was designed for children volunteers to take part in the show with English expressions learned on the spot.
