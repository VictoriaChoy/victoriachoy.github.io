I would complete the courses for IB educator certificate in August. After that, I would continue the MEd. courses in September, focusing on IB leadership and IB advanced learning and teaching. After I acquire the degree in 2025, I would go on to study PGDE program in Hong Kong because my mother has settled down in the region. I would try to find a teaching position in one of the many world-renowned IB schools there, and continue professional learning for IB leadership. Here is the first course grading of the MEd.
