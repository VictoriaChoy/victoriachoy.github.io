## Project-based Experiential Learning in a Hands-on Approach

项目式体验式学习，注重动手能力的培养

I have been practicing the **project-based** and **hands-on** approach since I began to teach at _EF_. I have designed a number of realia, teaching aids, and projects to engage students in effective learning with a **cost-effective** approach. I also rely on my personality and body language to engage early learners. Here are some examples.

自从我开始在EF任教以来，我一直在实践项目式学习。我设计了许多实物教具和项目，以低成本的方法让学生参与有效学习。我还依靠个性和肢体语言来吸引早期学习者。这里有些例子。

Laminated paper roulettes with attachable magnet for the interative whiteboard were used for phonics and counting toys with literacy.

过塑纸轮盘，是一款可吸附在交互式白板上、用于自然拼读、识字和计数的教具。

The letter monster was designed for phonics, including phonetic proficiency associated with the recognition of letter shapes. Students had fun fetching a card from the monster's mouth and shouting out the names of letters in a competition.

字母怪物是为自然拼读设计的，包括与字母形状识别相关的语音能力。学生们可以开心地从怪物嘴里取出一张卡片，并比赛大声喊出字母的名字。

The handicraft medals were meant for primary students' play of first aid for heat stroke frequent in summer in the local area of south China, connecting with science (climate change), P.S.P.E, arts, mathematical graphs, and literacy, in order to inquire about the **transdisciplinary theme** "how the world works", emphasising the impact of human activities on the nature.

手工奖牌是为小学生跨学科戏剧表演设计的。主题为华南地区夏季多发中暑的事故进行急救，结合的学科有科学（气候变化）、个人、社会与体育教育、艺术、 数学制图和语言，探究的跨学科主题是“世界如何运转”，强调人类活动对自然的影响。

Students were being dressed up like the characters in the picture book about a constume party from _Oxford Reading Tree_.

学生们打扮得像绘本中的人物，取材自牛津阅读树关于化装舞会的绘本。

### Solutions to the Learning Difficulties of a Six-year-ol Girl

一个六岁女孩学习困难的解决方案

The 6-year-old girl loved handicraft and arts. After learning elementary English for three months, including phonics, _Everybody Up Foundation_ (2nd edition), extensive reading with picture books, and cartoons from Disney English, she began to have the **STEAM** classes in a **hands-on approach**. In the first few classes, we made props of different celestial bodies in the galaxy, based on the learning materials from _Generation Genius_. In the beginning, she found it hard to make a complete presentation of the patterns in the sky even after a full understanding of the knowledge with her own writing of the key sentences on the white board, but kept her promise to make more attempts after my encouragement. Although she was quick-tempered and unable to concentrate on tasks as long as normal Chinese first graders are, she would certainly be more devoted to interesting tasks with a supporter.

我曾经教过一个6 岁的女孩，她喜欢手工艺和艺术。 在学习了三个月的基础英语，包括自然拼读、Everybody Up Foundation（第二版）、绘本泛读、迪士尼英语动画后，她开始上STEAM实验课程。 在前几节课，我们根据美国STEAM课程设计商“Generation Genius”的学习资料，制作了银河系不同天体的道具。 一开始，即使她已经在白板上写下关键句，并充分理解了知识，也很难将天体运转规律完整呈现出来，但在我的鼓励下，她承诺会多做一些尝试。虽然她脾气暴躁，不能像普通的中国一年级学生那样专注于任务，但她肯定会更专注于有支持者的有趣学习。

#### Phonics Reading Dubbing

After learning English for three months, the girl started to dub picture books via an app that provides evaluation reports on the speaking quality. The girl felt very proud with the feedbacks and grades as positive reinforcement to motivate her further efforts.

在学了三个月的英语后，女孩开始通过一个提供口语质量评估报告的应用程序来配音绘本。 女孩对配音反馈和成绩感到非常自豪，因为这些反馈和成绩是激励她进一步努力的积极因素。
