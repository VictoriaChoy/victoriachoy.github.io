The feedback comes from a university student majoring in arts and design. As per her feedback, she has acknowledged teacher agency although much more can be done to raise her interest in English learning, especially preparation for IELTS. Her recent experience in travelling to Tibet would be the next topic to explore. The relevance of learning to her experience would be emphasized in future lesson plans. Personally, I have never asked about her keenness in her major, which would be interesting to talk about, despite my previous intention to connect exam-preparation learning to her major, particularly the commercial or industrial application.
