# Teaching Philosophy

<img src="thinking s.gif" align="left"/>

My preliminary understanding of teaching philosophy is about the **student-centered** methodology.

When I began to study the first course for the IB educator certificate in the early 2021, I aligned my earlier practice with the **humanistic approach** that emphasizes students' interest and engagement as key elements in effective learning and teaching.

Then earlier this year, through the further study of the first MEd. course on educational context, including educational philosophy, history and sociology, I have aligned my years of practice with John Dewey's **progressivism**, Freire Paulo's **critical pedagogy**, and **humanism**, especially the **new humanism** proposed by UNESCO aiming to integrate the western humanism with the eastern counterpart, complying with the **IB mission** to "develop internationally minded people who, recognizing their common humanity and shared guardianship of the planet, help to create a better and more peaceful world", based on intercultural understanding and mutual respect.

The journey of inquiry about my teaching philosophy turns out impactful for the rest of my life and those I know that would like to become part of **IB's global community**. Please spare me a few minutes to talk about my story of inquiry.

After working in foreign trade of OEM products such as sensors and cables for ABB industrial robot arms for six years, I started my teaching career in quest of my own potential, freedom, identity, and a meaningful life. I chose not to work in a public school after I acquired an English teaching certificate for high school because of insufficient networking and possible restrictions on teaching at a public school. Thus I chose to work in the private sector which served middle-class families in particular. Beginning from IELTS and TOEFL examination technique preparation, I tried to look for a job that was irreplaceable, unlike the previous ones I got as a deputy general manager or a foreign trade manager. Then I began to realize that something was wrong, after witnessing studentsâ€™ struggle against exam-oriented education and resentment of English learning. It has prompted me with a long journey to inquire about studentsâ€™ early-year experiences for their typical problems in their later life, and the most important of all, the effective methods to cultivate studentsâ€™ interest for English learning.
